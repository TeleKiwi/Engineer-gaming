Hey look, buddy. I'm an engineer, that means I solve problems. 
Not problems like "What is beauty?", 'cause that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. 
I solve practical problems!
For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean Mother-Hubbard from tearin' me a structurally superfluous new behind?
The answer? Use a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun.
Like this, heavy-caliber tripod-mounted little-old-number designed by me. 
Built, by me.
And you best hope... 
Not pointed at you.
